## Map Information

The Bishops Land Recreation Area topography is a direct result of the Glacial Lake Missoula floods. Ancient flood waters poured through the Quincy area and scoured trenches and pools adjacent to the existing Columbia River. These scoured areas have created small buttes and valleys that create a warren of navigable terrain. The area is covered with sage and low-lying vegetation that can obscure smaller point features. However, good contact with the map will provide plenty of attack points and catching features. There are enough roads and trails crossing the east half of the venue to allow for challenges for the younger runners. Due to the seemingly endless channels, courses can provide equal challenges north and south as well as east and west. The venue is a course designer’s dream and a competitor’s welcome challenge.

*Reminder that the map shows embargoed areas, and that possession of the map does not imply permission to enter.*

* There are numerous and random animal trails. These are characterized by indistinct paths amongst the sagebrush that appear and disappear and are often difficult to identify from the runners eye level, but will occasionally be noticed. These trails were omitted from the map, unless they were observed to be very distinct and followable.

* The bare rock symbol and the stony ground symbol are used to describe similar features: high rocky ground, free of vegetation.

* At Bishops Land, the stony ground symbol was almost universally replaced with the bare rock symbol.

* At Bishop's Land, the bare rock symbol is associated with vegetation less ground, typically due to rock formations. The stony ground symbol was not used at Bishop’s Land to indicate high-rocky ground as it was at Frenchman or Quincy Lakes.

# Model Event at Frenchman Spring

![Frenchman Spring](/assets/img/FrenchmanSpring300.jpg)

The model course will be open 10:00am-4:00pm on Friday and 7:00am-3:00pm on Saturday. See the full [schedule](/schedule).

## Map & Course Information

The Frenchman Spring map is located North of Vantage Rd. Use this area to familiarize yourself with the terrain and features you'll see at all the venues this weekend. The relatively flat area with small cliffs, rocky features and various densities of sagebrush is very similar to the terrain at all three competition venues.

<div class="notification is-info is-light">
<strong>Please print your own map if possible</strong>. A limited number of maps will be available on site in a bin by the gate.
</div>

The model map is available in both 1:10,000 and 1:7,500 scale on the same Letter size page.

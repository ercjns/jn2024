## Dinner

Saturday 6:00pm - 8:00pm at the Quincy Business & Event Center

Come join your fellow orienteers for an evening of fellowship and good food. Trade stories of glory earned and opportunities missed from the earlier Frenchman Coulee NRE. Or, catch up with good friends from out of state clubs. Awards for Friday's NRE will be presented at the end of the meal. Dinner will be tamales, rice, and refried beans from the local Delicioso Tamale restaurant along with a drink, chips, salsa, and cookies provided by COC. Adult meals will come with three tamales and the junior meals will be served with two tamales.
